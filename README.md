# Disaster-Data-Cleaning-Analysis-with-API-Integration
This project performs comprehensive data cleaning, processing, and feature engineering on a disaster events dataset. It leverages Python and Pandas for data manipulation, and integrates with external APIs to impute missing geographical data (locations, latitudes, and longitudes), resulting in a clean and enriched dataset.
